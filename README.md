Programming Assignment 1
===============================================
This is the repository for all the programming assignment 1 related material.
Project requires the implementation of the Manhattan verifier on a well-known keystroke biometrics data set.  

Notes
===============================================
The following notes are key in terms of being able to compile the program correctly.

1.  The IDE - I have implemented Visual Studio Ultimate 2013 IDE on my Windows 8.1 laptop.  However, the project that I have built can run on Windows 7 machines.  So please ensure that Visual Studio 2013 Express for Desktop IDE.  This is an important point to note because then that way the code can be compiled in its entirety. 
2.  How to access the .exe file:  There will be a section here in this README file, and I will have the section ready when the time comes appropriately. 

Submission Deadline/Due Date
===============================================
Here, this repository is going to be used for the actual submission of the assignment.  The due date of this assignment is next week: December 2nd, 2014 on or before 11:59 pm.  

Accessing the Executable File
===============================================
Please follow the following steps in order to be able to access the executable file (.exe).


1. Navigate to the folder that reads "ProgrammingAssignment1_SpecialTopics"
2. In this folder there are various subfolders, one of which reads "bin\Debug" click navigate to that folder. 
3. Finally, in this folder named "bin\Debug" you should find the executable file (.exe extension) with the file name of "ProgrammingAssignment1_SpecialTopics.exe"

When Executing This Code
================================================
Please do note that when you are executing this program, there are CSV files used as the data input for the program.  Please ensure that you change the directories of the files accordingly that way there are no mishaps.  

Changes
========
1. The code has been completed to be able to calculate both Impostor Pass Rate and False Reject Rate.  
2. I have been able to select five thresholds which I plan to examine and change the sampling size from 100 samples to 300 samples. 
3. I have also made a change in the report.
