Programming Assignment 1
===============================================
This is the repository for all the programming assignment 1 related material.
Project requires the implementation of the Manhattan verifier on a well-known keystroke biometrics data set.  

Notes
===============================================
The following notes are key in terms of being able to compile the program correctly.

1.  The IDE - I have implemented Visual Studio Ultimate 2013 IDE on my Windows 8.1 laptop.  However, the project that I have built can run on Windows 7 machines.  So please ensure that Visual Studio 2013 Express for Desktop IDE.  This is an important point to note because then that way the code can be compiled in its entirety.
