Programming Assignment 1
===============================================
This is the repository for all the programming assignment 1 related material.
Project requires the implementation of the Manhattan verifier on a well-known keystroke biometrics data set.  

Notes
===============================================
The following notes are key in terms of being able to compile the program correctly.

1.  The IDE - I have implemented Visual Studio Ultimate 2013 IDE on my Windows 8.1 laptop.  However, the project that I have built can run on Windows 7 machines.  So please ensure that Visual Studio 2013 Express for Desktop IDE.  This is an important point to note because then that way the code can be compiled in its entirety. 
2.  How to access the .exe file:  There will be a section here in this README file, and I will have the section ready when the time comes appropriately. 

This repository
===============================================
Here, this repository is going to be used for the actual submission of the assignment.  The due date of this assignment is next week: December 2nd, 2014 on or before 11:59 pm.
