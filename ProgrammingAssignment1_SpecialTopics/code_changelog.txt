Code Changelog

23rd November 2014
* Beginning to formally write the logic out, and having an idea.
* Now checking for the existence of a file
 
24th November 2014
* Will be slowly implementing the concept of using the files to pull the data, and be able to begin to parse everything for analysis.
* Now I am writing the code for only one user to make sure that the logic is working correctly.  Then, later on this week I will definitely be incorporating multiple users, and use various "if..." statements to be able to control the program flow.  
* It will take up a lot of lines of code, but I hope it will get the job done in the long run.

25th November 2014
* Tearing this code down, and will now be reconstructing this code with the latest developments which I know have worked after testing various methods.  
* I will be able to have the user select the user(s) and the sample size (N) for which they can be able to calculate and generate the genuine scores.
* For now, I will have the data being shown so that way I know that my logic is working as I originally envisioned/thought of.
* Now here is the plan of attack:
     1. Take the PasswordData.csv file and break it up into 50 or so separate csv files based upon the user subject ID
	 2. Have my code that is below to be user friendly, and (hopefully) efficient enough where the user can be able to control the experiments. 

26th November 2014
* Finally, I have been able to get going on the formal programming of this assignment.
* Here, I can be able to extract N samples from a CSV file properly.  
* Next here, the template generation is going to be key, and then genuine and impostor score generation using the samples.  Finally, I have to be able to calculate the False Accept and False Reject rates at various thresholds.

28th November 2014
* I plan to code the template creation, genuine score calculation, and the impostor score calculation methods today.  
* I will adjust the parameters accordingly, and will also have to code the various method calls to extract the data from all of the CSV files. 
* Making the end useability as seamless and as clear as possible.

	Accomplishments:
	* Calculated the template vectors correctly
	* Do not need to ensure that the data is being extracted for one user - Already have that printed before

29th November 2014
* Today I have to write out the code for the other users to extract the data and calculate the template vectors.
* Next, I will have to code the genuine and impostor calculation methods
* After that, code the calculations for the impostor pass rate and the false reject rate at various thresholds.

30th November 2014
* Today I am coding the data extraction and template creation of more users.
* Also, I plan to write the method to calculate the genuine scores
* Wrote another method to extract the samples based on the sampling size given by the end user for analysis. Which thereby will make the next tasks that are required easier. 
* <c>ExtractSamples</c> was refactored as <c>ExtractTrainingSamples</c> to make the extraction of the N training samples easier
  
  Accomplishments:
  * Finished the coding for all 51 users to have the CSV data extracted
  * All the 51 users can now have their template vectors calculated. 

1st December 2014
* Got the method of extracting test samples working
* Have to finish off this project and code the genuine score and impostor score methods
* Finally have to code the method to calculate the Impostor Pass Rate and False Reject Rates given a Threshold T. 

2nd December 2014 - Deadline/Submission date
Here are the following that I tasks that I need to get done today:
* Code and execute all the impostor scores
* Find a way that I can begin to report the FAR and FRR
* Compile the report - Started

  Accomplishments: 
  * Genuine score - Coded and function calls made
